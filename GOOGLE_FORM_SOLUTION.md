# Google Form Creation Solution

## ðŸš¨ Issue Identified: Drive Storage Quota Exceeded

The service account's Google Drive storage quota has been exceeded, which is preventing the creation of new Google Forms. Here are the solutions:

## Solution 1: Fix Service Account Quota (Recommended)

### Step 1: Check and Clean Up Drive Storage
```bash
# Run this to check current usage and clean up
source venv/bin/activate && python -c "
import json
from google.oauth2 import service_account
from googleapiclient.discovery import build

credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
    'msai-service-key.json', 
    scopes=['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file']
)

drive_service = build('drive', 'v3', credentials=credentials)

# List all files
results = drive_service.files().list(pageSize=100, fields='files(id,name,mimeType,size)').execute()
files = results.get('files', [])

print(f'Total files: {len(files)}')
for file in files:
    print(f'- {file[\"name\"]} ({file[\"mimeType\"]}) - ID: {file[\"id\"]}')

# Delete old files if needed
# Uncomment the lines below to delete files (BE CAREFUL!)
# for file in files:
#     if 'test' in file['name'].lower() or 'old' in file['name'].lower():
#         drive_service.files().delete(fileId=file['id']).execute()
#         print(f'Deleted: {file[\"name\"]}')
"
```

1. Go to IAM & Admin > Service Accounts
2. Create new service account
3. Download new key file
4. Update the script to use the new key

### Step 4: Configure Form Settings
1. Click the Settings gear icon
2. Enable "Collect email addresses"
3. Enable "Limit to 1 response per person"
4. Enable "Show progress bar"
5. Set confirmation message: "Thank you for your application to the MS AI program! We will review your application and contact you within 2-3 weeks."

### Step 5: Set Up Response Collection
1. Click "Responses" tab
2. Click "Create Spreadsheet" to link a Google Sheet
3. This will automatically collect all responses

## Solution 4: Use Google Apps Script (Advanced)

If you want to automate the form creation, you can use Google Apps Script:

1. Go to [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com)
2. Create a new project
3. Use the Forms API to create the form programmatically
4. This bypasses the service account quota issues

## Recommended Immediate Action

**I recommend using Solution 3 (Manual Creation)** because:
1. âœ… **Immediate** - You can create the form right now
2. âœ… **No technical issues** - No API or quota problems
3. âœ… **Full control** - You can customize everything
4. âœ… **Reliable** - No dependency on external services

Once you have the manual form created, you can always come back to automate it later when the quota issues are resolved.

## Next Steps

1. **Create the form manually** using the structure above
2. **Test the form** with sample data
3. **Customize the appearance** to match your branding
4. **Set up response collection** with Google Sheets
5. **Deploy to your website** and start accepting applications
