## Option 3: Fix Google Forms API (Advanced)

If you want to use the programmatic approach, here's how to fix the API issues:

### Troubleshooting Steps:

1. **Check API Permissions:**
   ```bash
   # Verify the service account has the correct roles
   # Go to Google Cloud Console > IAM & Admin > IAM
   # Ensure the service account has:
   # - Editor role (or more specific roles)
   # - Google Forms API User
   # - Google Drive API User
   ```

2. **Enable Required APIs:**
   - Go to Google Cloud Console
   - Navigate to APIs & Services > Library
   - Enable these APIs:
     - Google Forms API
     - Google Drive API
     - Google Sheets API

3. **Check Service Account Key:**
   ```bash
   # Verify the service account key is valid
   cat msai-service-key.json | jq .
   ```

4. **Test API Access:**
   ```bash
   # Test with a simple API call
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
        "https://forms.googleapis.com/v1/forms"
   ```

5. **Try Different Approach:**
   - Use OAuth instead of service account
   - Create form with minimal content first
   - Add questions in smaller batches

## Recommended Approach

**I recommend using Option 1 (HTML Form)** because:

1. âœ… **Immediate Availability** - Ready to use right now
2. âœ… **Full Control** - Complete customization possible
3. âœ… **No API Issues** - No dependency on Google APIs
4. âœ… **Professional Appearance** - Beautiful, responsive design
5. âœ… **Easy Integration** - Can be embedded in any website
6. âœ… **Data Collection** - Can be easily connected to backend systems

## Next Steps

1. **Test the HTML Form:**
   - Open `msai_application_form.html` in your browser
   - Fill out a test application
   - Verify all validation works correctly

2. **Deploy the Form:**
   - Upload to your web server
   - Add to your university website
   - Set up data collection backend

3. **Customize as Needed:**
   - Modify styling to match your exact branding
   - Add additional questions if needed
   - Integrate with your existing systems

4. **Set Up Data Processing:**
   - Create backend to handle form submissions
   - Set up email notifications
   - Create admin dashboard for reviewing applications
